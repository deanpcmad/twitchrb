[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/twitchrb.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/twitchrb)

TwitchRB is the easiest and most complete Ruby library for the [Twitch Helix API](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "twitchrb"
```

## Usage

### Set Client Details

Firstly you'll need to set a Client ID and an Access Token.

An access token is required because the Helix API requires authentication.

```ruby
@client = Twitch::Client.new(client_id: "abc123", access_token: "xyz123")
```

### Resources

The gem maps as closely as we can to the Twitch API so you can easily convert API examples to gem code.

Responses are created as objects like `Twitch::Channel`. Having types like `Twitch::User` is handy for understanding what
type of object you're working with. They're built using OpenStruct so you can easily access data in a Ruby-ish way.

### Pagination

Some of the endpoints return pages of results. The result object will have a `data` key to access the results, as well as metadata like `cursor`
for retrieving the next and previous pages. This can be used by using `before` and `after` parameters, on API endpoints that support it.

An example of using collections, including pagination:

```ruby
results = @client.clips.list(broadcaster_id: 123)
#=> Twitch::Collection

results.total
#=> 30

results.data
#=> [#<Twitch::Clip>, #<Twitch::Clip>]

results.each do |result|
  puts result.id
end

results.first
#=> #<Twitch::Clip>

results.last
#=> #<Twitch::Clip>

results.cursor
#=> "abc123"

# Retrieve the next page
@client.clips.list(broadcaster_id: 123, after: results.cursor)
#=> Twitch::Collection
```

### OAuth

This library includes the ability to create, refresh and revoke OAuth tokens.

```ruby
# Firstly, set the client details
@oauth = Twitch::OAuth.new(client_id: "", client_secret: "")

# Create a Token
# grant_type can be either "authorization_code" or "client_credentials"
# scope is a space-delimited list of scopes. This is optional depending on the grant_type
@oauth.create(grant_type: "", scope: "")

# Refresh a Token
@oauth.refresh(refresh_token: "")

# Device Code Grant Flow
# scopes is required and is a space-delimited list of scopes
# https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/authentication/getting-tokens-oauth/#device-code-grant-flow
@oauth.device(scopes: "bits:read channel:read:subscriptions")

# Validate an Access Token
# Returns false if the token is invalid
@oauth.validate(token: "")

# Revoke a Token
@oauth.revoke(token: "")
```
